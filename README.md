### Project Description/Summary
This project is very similar to the Testimonials JavaScript Project. I did find it a lot easier, however. For this image slider, when an arrow is clicked, the next image in the array shows up.
### New Things Learned or Refreshed
Before doing this project, I didn't realize how easy it was to make a slider project. I thought it was just a jQuery thing. Turns out I was wrong.
### Time to Code
This took about 15 minutes to code
### Lines of Code
This took me 35 lines of code.
### Biggest Take Away(s)
Image sliders aren't a jQuery thing. All I had to do was access different images from inside of an array. And to make accessing each image easier, I just needed to make sure images had the same name but different numbers so they can be accessed by an index.
## Your Turn!
### What to Accomplish
1. Download the source code from the github repository above.
2. Delete the contents of the app.js file.
3. Implement the JavaScript code in your own app.js file.
4. Add a link to your finished project below!
### What You Should See
1. A default image should be displayed when you load the page.
2. When you click the “left” button, one of five images should display, all the way until each of the five numbers display in sequence.
3. Repeat step 2 for the “right” button.
